This code relates to the project "Electrophysiological signatures of veridical head direction in humans" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.26.525724v1). It has been run using a Linux server, Matlab 2021a and the Fieldtrip toolbox (pulled from Github on 11th July 2022). To use this code, simply clone or pull a copy from this repository, set your working directory to the git folder, and run the first script ('server_exp1_runFEM.m'). The time taken to install should not take longer than a few minutes. The code uses hard-coded directories which will need to be adapted to wherever you store the data. Running all scripts should produce the results and figures presented in the manuscript. Given the large number of conditions and iterations involved in the analysis, the run-time can be several days on a server. It is unknown how long the run-time would be for a "normal" desktop computer". An example dataset can be accessed here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4cy33k1ggoayaws/sub-02_task-nav_eeg-complete.mat?dl=0.
